Used OOP / classes for the reading of the data. I wanted to separate the actual reading of the file and the printing of it's contents. Thought OOP was the way to go as I recently started using it and it seems like a good way encapsulate data. 

Disclaimer: I would never use such passwords from the example text file, it's just what came to my mind when testing.
